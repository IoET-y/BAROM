# Latent Space Learning for PDE Systems with Complex Boundary Conditions (BAROM)

## Abstract
Latent space Reduced Order Models (ROMs) in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) can enhance and accelerate Partial Differential Equation (PDE) simulations. However, they often struggle with complex boundary conditions (BCs) such as time-varying, nonlinear, or state-dependent ones. Current methods for handling BCs in latent space have limitations due to representation mismatch and projection difficulty, impacting predictive accuracy and physical consistency. To address this, we introduce BAROM (Boundary-Aware Attention ROM). BAROM integrates: (1) explicit, Reduced Basis Methods-inspired boundary treatment using a modified ansatz and a learnable lifting network for complex BCs; and (2) a non-intrusive, attention-based mechanism, inspired by Galerkin Neural Operators, to learn internal field dynamics within a POD-initialized latent space. Evaluations show BAROM achieves superior accuracy and robustness on benchmark PDEs with diverse complex BCs compared to established SciML approaches.

## üìú Overview
This repository contains the source code and experimental setup for the BAROM model, as presented in the paper "Latent Space Learning for PDE Systems with Complex Boundary." BAROM is a novel framework designed to accurately and efficiently simulate PDE systems, particularly those with complex, dynamic, and feedback-dependent boundary conditions.

The core contributions include:
* An explicit boundary-internal field decomposition inspired by Reduced Basis Methods (RBM).
* A learnable lifting network to handle non-homogeneous boundary conditions.
* A Boundary-Aware Attention (BAA) mechanism for evolving latent coefficients, making the model responsive to boundary changes.
* Two main variants:
    * **BAROM\_ImpBC**: Handles boundary conditions implicitly during the latent dynamics update. (Implemented in `PDE_category1/BAROM_ImpBC.py` and `PDE_category2/BAROM_ImpBC.py`)
    * **BAROM\_ExpBC**: Explicitly processes boundary parameters to inform the latent dynamics update, aligning with Equation (9) in the paper. (Implemented in `PDE_category2/BAROM_ExpBC.py`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è The BAROM Model (Equation 9 Aligned Version)

The primary version of BAROM, referred to as **BAROM\_ExpBC** in the paper and implemented primarily in `PDE_category2/BAROM_ExpBC.py`, uses an explicit boundary treatment mechanism. The key evolution step for the latent coefficients $\mathbf{a}$ aligns with Equation (9) from the paper:

$\mathbf{a}^{n+1} = \underbrace{\mathbf{a}^{n} + \Delta\mathbf{a}_{\text{attn}} + \Delta\mathbf{a}_{\text{ffn}}}_{\text{Internal Dynamics (Learned)}} + \underbrace{\Delta\mathbf{a}_{\text{bc}}}_{\text{Learned from } P_{BC}(t_{k+1})} \quad (*)$
*(Note: The original paper's Equation (9) is $a^{n+1} = \hat{A}_{a}a^{n} + \hat{B}\hat{w}^{n} + \hat{A}_{BC}U_{B}^{n} - \Phi^{T}U_{B}^{n+1}$. The $\Delta\mathbf{a}_{\text{bc}}$ term in the code and paper description aims to encapsulate the influence of boundary parameters $P_{BC}(t_{k+1})$ on the latent state, which conceptually covers terms like $\hat{B}\hat{w}^{n} + \hat{A}_{BC}U_{B}^{n} - \Phi^{T}U_{B}^{n+1}$ in a learned, potentially more direct manner when $P_{BC}$ is used to derive features that directly update $a^n$. The code provided has been updated to more directly reflect the structure of this equation, particularly the inclusion of $U_B^{n+1}$ effects).*

The model reconstructs the physical solution using:
$\hat{U}^{n+1} = U_B(P_{BC}(t_{k+1})) + \mathbf{\Phi} \mathbf{a}^{n+1}$

Key components:
* **Lifting Network (`UniversalLifting` class)**: Maps boundary parameters $P_{BC}(t)$ to the boundary field $U_B(x,t)$.
* **Learnable Basis Functions ($\mathbf{\Phi}$)**: Initialized with POD and refined during training. Stored as `model.Phi`.
* **Latent Dynamics (`MultiVarAttentionROMEq9.forward_step`)**:
    * Calculates $U_B^n = \mathcal{L}_{\text{lift}}(P_{BC}(t_n))$.
    * Calculates $U_B^{n+1} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{lift}}(P_{BC}(t_{n+1}))$.
    * $\Delta\mathbf{a}_{\text{attn}}$: From multi-head attention.
    * $\Delta\mathbf{a}_{\text{ffn}}$: From a feed-forward network.
    * $\Delta\mathbf{a}_{\text{bc}}$: Explicitly processes $P_{BC}(t_{n+1})$ to update latent coefficients. The implementation details of how $P_{BC}(t_n)$ and $P_{BC}(t_{n+1})$ map to the terms in the original Eq. (9) ($\hat{B}\hat{w}^{n}$, $\hat{A}_{BC}U_{B}^{n}$, and $-\Phi^{T}U_{B}^{n+1}$) are embedded within the `bc_driven_a_update` and the direct subtraction of the $\Phi^{T}U_B^{n+1}$ projection.
